The court coverage changes. And if you&apos;re not playing to your team&apos;s actual strengths, you&apos;re leaving points on the table. </p><p>Brittany, a pro player competing in APP and PPA pro qualifiers, <strong>breaks down five essential tips for winning in mixed doubles</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb4pESz8N7c&amp;ref=thedinkpickleball.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">straight from her experience on the court.</a></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"></figure><p><em><strong>Love pickleball?</strong> Then you&apos;ll love our </em><a href=\"https://subscribe.thedinkpickleball.com/?utm_campaign=How_to_WIN_in_Pickleball_Strategy_Mixed_Pro_Tips&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_source=thedink\"><em>free newsletter</em></a><em>. We send the latest news, tips, and highlights for free each week.</em></p><h3 id=\"forget-the-5050-court-split\">Forget the 50/50 Court Split</h3><p>Mixed doubles isn&apos;t always a 50/50 court split between the man and woman. Sometimes it is. Often, it isn&apos;t.</p><p>Brittany plays with a 6&apos;8&quot; lefty partner who can reach and poke balls out of the air like few others can. <strong>That means she&apos;s not getting 50% of the court. She&apos;s getting closer to 20 or 30%. </strong>And that&apos;s completely fine.</p><p>The key is recognizing your team&apos;s actual strengths and playing to them. If your partner has a longer wingspan, better reach, or a devastating forehand, let them take the shots that suit them best. </p><ul><li>Sometimes you slide over and let your partner poke</li><li>Sometimes your partner leaves an opening and you come through the middle to put it away</li></ul><p>It&apos;s not about ego. It&apos;s about what&apos;s best for your team.</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<div id=\"om-iua4gvmvaprypevxt7do-holder\"></div>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n<h3 id=\"communication-wins-matches\">Communication Wins Matches</h3><p>You can&apos;t play good mixed doubles without talking to your partner. Constantly.</p><p>Call which ball is yours. Call which ball is theirs. In Brittany&apos;s case, she&apos;s on the left side and her partner is on the right, which means the middle is both their forehands. <strong>Without clear communication, you&apos;re going to have collisions or missed balls.</strong></p><p>But communication goes beyond just calling the ball. </p><blockquote><strong>It&apos;s about being a good partner when things aren&apos;t going well. </strong></blockquote><p>Sometimes your partner is down. Sometimes you&apos;re both struggling. That&apos;s when you pick each other up, encourage them, and talk through what&apos;s happening.</p><p>Some partners like coaching during games. Others prefer it after. Figure out what works for your team and stick with it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://www.thedinkpickleball.com/pickleball-fans-hate-this-mixed-doubles-strategy-but-it-just-won-ppa-gold/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Pickleball Fans Hate This Mixed Doubles Strategy &#x2014; But it Just Won PPA Gold</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Love or hate Christian Alshon&#x2019;s all-out court coverage at PPA Minnesota, one thing is undeniable: it worked</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img alt=\"5 Mixed Doubles Tips to Win More Pickleball Matches\" class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://www.thedinkpickleball.com/content/images/icon/publication-icon-72-1104.png\" /><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">The Dink Pickleball</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Alex E.

If you know your opponents, discuss where your returns should go. Should you target someone&apos;s backhand? Their forehand? Where are the weaknesses you can attack?</p><p>Even if you&apos;ve never seen your opponents before, you can adjust on the fly. Watch the first few points. Notice if someone keeps missing into the net. Notice if someone&apos;s backhand is weaker. Notice if they&apos;re a righty-lefty duo like you are. Then adjust your targeting accordingly.</p><p>Having a plan keeps your mind locked in and gives you direction when things get tight.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">&#x1f4a1;</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\"><b><strong style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Need some new pickleball gear?</strong></b> Get 20% off select paddles, shoes, and more with code THEDINK at <a href=\"https://www.midwestracquetsports.com/pickleball/?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=2280835&amp;sscid=95803_1761838624_842a58d5fb94f386ea96644df3f530ee&amp;awc=95803_1761838624_842a58d5fb94f386ea96644df3f530ee&amp;ref=thedinkpickleball.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Midwest Racquet Sports</a></div></div><h3 id=\"dont-forget-to-have-fun\">Don&apos;t Forget to Have Fun</h3><p>This might sound simple, but it&apos;s the most important tip of all.</p><p>When you&apos;re having fun, you&apos;re not stressed.

Better Pickleball shares two simple ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Arm circles:</strong> Put your arms forward with your pointer fingers extended and circle your arms all the way around.

    "content": "<p>It&#8217;s that time once again when USA Pickleball rolls out its annual pickleball rule changes for the coming year. For those that submitted a potential rule change, the verdict of such proposed changes is now in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process for the 2026 pickleball rule changes that began with USA Pickleball members&#8217; suggested changes in April of 2025 \u2013 and after pickleball rules committee and board of directors approval \u2013 culminates with a target implementation date of January 1, 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">114 Proposed Changes for 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://rules.usapickleball.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Rulebook Database</a>, there were 114 suggested USA Pickleball rule changes for 2026 \u2013 down slightly from the 133 changes proposed a year earlier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Approved by USA Pickleball for 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> It is important to note that any paid USA Pickleball member may submit a proposed rule change for 2026 as long as it was submitted between April 1, 2025 and June 1, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once submitted and collected in the New Rulebook Database, these proposed changes were then subject to public comment until June 15, 2025.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, they were reviewed by the USA Pickleball Rules Committee and were ultimately given the thumbs up or thumbs down by the USA Pickleball Board of Directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Of the 114 suggested rule changes, 72 were disapproved, 23 were approved and another 19 were approved with amendments.</strong> While most of the approved (or approved with amendments) changes were simple wordsmith changes, formatting changes or simple clarifications, we wanted to underscore four of the more substantial approved changes for 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.  Rally Scoring Wining Point</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This rule change (a change to Rule #12.B.1.c) now simply states that the game-winning point when using rally scoring can now be scored by either the serving player or team or the receiving player or team. The rule previously stated that only the game-winning point could be scored by the serving team. This potential freeze at game point created an unfair advantage for the trailing team as they could score points as the receiving team, but the team frozen could not. I like this new rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.  Paddle Spin on the Serve</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As an instructor, I field the question about the legality of imparting spin on one&#8217;s serve quite frequently.  Rule #7.B.2 now adds clarification that \u2013 although spin is not permitted prior to contact with the ball during the serve \u2013 spin may, indeed, be applied to the serve at contact by the paddle. This is a much needed and helpful clarification.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Solution to the &#8220;Flat Serve&#8221; Problem (No Upward Arc)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The legality of the pickleball volley serve has always seemingly been a point of contention.  After all, three criteria must be met when executing this serve and, as such, it is very difficult to determine in real time if all three criteria are, indeed, met:  an upward arc, paddle head above the wrist at contact and contact below the waist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change for 2026 is simply to add the word, &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;clearly.&#8221; The reworded rule now states that the server\u2019s paddle must be moving in a <strong>clear upward arc</strong> when the paddle contacts the ball (Rule # 7.C.1), the highest point of the paddle head must <strong>clearly</strong> not be above the highest part of the server\u2019s wrist joint when the paddle contacts the ball (Rule # 7.C.2 ) and the ball must <strong>clearly</strong> be no higher than the server\u2019s waist when the paddle contacts the ball (Rule # 7.C.3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m not convinced that will help anything.&nbsp; In fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure it won&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Prompt Line Calls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The prompt line calls revision just attempts to codify some common-sense into the timing of &#8220;out&#8221; calls (Rules #8.F.3). Getting into the weeds of this discussion isn&#8217;t likely useful, unless you are a referee.  Common sense should prevail and &#8220;out&#8221; calls should continue to be made (verbally or with hand signals) promptly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, calling these four examples substantial changes may, indeed, reek of hyperbole.\u00a0 This lack of huge changes is, no doubt, good for the sport. As the Rulebook change process is now an annual and transparent process, the changes become less-and-less substantial over the years\u00a0 No longer is the sport consistently dealing with chainsaw serves or other big-ticket items.\u00a0 The changes now are mere tweaks and subtle changes to make the game we love even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Criteria for Consideration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there were initially 114 suggested pickleball rule changes for 2026, not all were seriously considered.&nbsp; For example, permitting overhand serving was a suggested change, but surely received zero support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be seriously considered \u2013 and ultimately approved \u2013 all proposed changes must be deemed to preserve the integrity of the sport, improve the player experience and/or minimize conflict (between players and/or referees).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us know in the comments below if USA Pickleball members, the rules committee, and, ultimately, the Board of Directors got it right. Are the approved rule changes beneficial for the sport?</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p>We are excited to announce that we\u2019ve launched another website \u2013 <a href=\"https://bestpickleballfacilities.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BestPickleballFacilities.com</a>! Building a website of this magnitude from scratch took time, so we are absolutely stoked to finally bring it to you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Cool&#8221; Pickleball Facilities!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, the website provides a directory of pickleball facilities. However, it is not intended to be just another list of places-to-play. These are truly the best facilities that are worth a visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some facilities have dedicated indoor pickleball courts, some have outdoor courts, and some have a mixture of both. However, what they all have in common is that they possess a &#8220;cool&#8221; factor! The facilities might have restaurants and bars, event spaces, or other activities and entertainment options onsite in addition to pickleball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to showcasing the different pickleball facilities and franchises throughout the United States, we also highlight venues with golf simulators, padel courts, rooftop courts, etc. Additionally, we&#8217;ve added some travel information for specific cities in case you&#8217;re like most players and want to play while out of town. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rate and Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, one of the most important features of Best Pickleball Facilities is the player review feature \u2013 reviews <em>not</em> generated by us, but rather by you \u2013 the player. Reviews are left by those of you who have actually visited a venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best Pickleball Facilities will be a valuable resource for pickleball enthusiasts (addicts) to find great (and local) opportunities to play, socialize, or improve their game \u2013 and, perhaps most importantly, to leave reviews of their experiences so others can benefit from your good (or not-so-good) experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Little Background</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PickleballMAX has been in the pickleball industry for several years (as content creators, instructors, tournament directors, and working at facilities) and, like you, we have witnessed incredible growth over the past few years. It\u2019s exhilarating to see so many people jumping into pickleball because, as we all know, it\u2019s fun for all ages, provides exercise and sociability, and is easy to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such rapid growth, however, comes the challenge of making the sport the best it can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a player (especially a new player), the scale and speed of growth can be overwhelming. With this new website, we sought to address and solve two major challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge #1 \u2013 No Review Site to Share Experiences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, this site was initially created to provide players an outlet to share their experiences at a pickleball facility \u2013 the good, the bad, and the ugly. There&#8217;s no doubt, players love to play at different venues.&nbsp;And different venues provide different amenities. Unfortunately, some facilities over-promise and under-deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the players\u2019 perspective, there is considerable money that can be spent at a facility. Players want to know which facilities have been a good experience and which should be avoided. Up until now, players have shared their experiences on social platforms since there wasn&#8217;t a centralized website repository for facility reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Solution \u2013 A Website to Rate &amp; Review Pickleball Facilities [&amp; More!]</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Best Pickleball Facilities.com was developed to be a website that is created and updated by pickleball players, for pickleball players. Players can add the facility they played at and, once the listing is approved, give it a review with various feature star ratings so other players will know if the facility is worth the time and money to play in in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reviews also provide valuable feedback for the facility so that changes (if any) can be implemented to make the players&#8217; experience that much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenge #2 \u2013 No Centralized Directory that Lists State-of-the-Art Pickleball Venues</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second challenge we identified was the need for a centralized pickleball directory \u2013 think Yelp for pickleball \u2013 where players/visitors can leave reviews detailing their personal experience(s) with respect to pickleball venues. Currently, the only way to find these venues is to do an online search or ask for recommendations on social platforms. Sadly, if you don\u2019t do the right search or ask the right question in the right pickleball group, you may be missing out on something really cool and exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best Pickleball Facilities.com was built to be a destination site where you, as a pickleball addict, can find exciting facilities (with reviews) all in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discover and Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"https://bestpickleballfacilities.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BestPickleballFacilities.com</a> and let others know about the site. Be sure to leave a review for one of the venues while you\u2019re there. It is our desire that this website will continue to help grow the sport of pickleball and become a great resource for all players!</p>",

    "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been exciting to watch the growth of pickleball over the past few years, especially in our home city of Cincinnati, Ohio! The number of players has increased exponentially as has the number of courts throughout the city and its suburbs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cincinnati is home to thousands of pickleball fanatics. It has some of the largest facilities for both indoor and outdoor courts in the state of Ohio and the tri-state area: Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PickleballMAX Has Made an Impact </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PickleballMAX has been part of the pickleball scene in Cincinnati for 10 years. Once moving to Ohio from Michigan, Todd began playing on the courts in Middletown, Ohio. We have seen those courts grow from 10 to 27 courts over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Todd began his coaching career on the courts in Middletown and is thankful for his clients who took a chance on him as he ventured into making it a full-time business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, Todd worked at a local community center coordinating pickleball for 150+ players. He has taught clinics at TriHealth, local Country Clubs, and area tennis facilities. As a team, we have shared the sport with hundreds of people throughout Cincinnati at local courts, companies, and schools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While he wouldn&#8217;t admit it himself, I believe Todd has been one of a handful of individuals who have been instrumental in the growth of pickleball throughout southwest Ohio over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Dink Tank Podcast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growth of pickleball in Cincinnati and the addition of more new players being exposed to the sport every day, Ben Woodall created a podcast to take people on a journey through the world of pickleball in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dink Tank explores the hidden gems and bustling hotspots where the sports passion comes alive. He interviews the people in the community who make the pickleball scene special. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of his interviews have included coaches, venue owners, and board members. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Todd Shares in the Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who knows pickleball in Cincinnati, Todd was asked to participate in an interview with Ben Woodall on The Dink Tank podcast.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the interview, Ben and Todd discuss Todd&#8217;s background &#8211; where it all began. In addition, they talk about the different pillars of PickleballMAX, tournaments, strategy tips, and the youth game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[As a note, Todd has experience playing in more tournaments than he mentioned in the interview. His first tournament was in <a href=\"https://www.pickleballmax.com/2015/09/early-tournaments-for-pickleballmax/\">Royal Oak, Michigan in 2015</a>. He has played and medaled in tournaments in Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Indiana, Kentucky, Vero Beach, FL, and the Beer City Open in Grand Rapids.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the interview titled &#8220;<strong>40 Years of Pickleball: Todd Jungling on Teaching, Tournament Direction, and Growing the Sport</strong>&#8221; on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/40-years-of-pickleball-todd-jungling-on-teaching/id1797033273?i=1000702602257\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">itunes</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0qwCtCNC2NqgmF0VpOiTet\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">spotify</a>, or listen to it below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 30px;\"></div>",
